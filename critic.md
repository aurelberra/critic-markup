# Darwin ipse

I WILL here {--attempt to--} give a brief{--, but imperfect--} sketch of the progress of opinion on the Origin of Species. {~~The~>Until recently the~~} great majority of naturalists {~~believe~>believed~~} that species {~~are~>were~~} immutable productions, and {~~have~>had~~} been separately created. This view has been ably maintained by many authors. Some few naturalists, on the other hand, {~~believe~>have believed~~} that species undergo modification, and that the existing forms of life {~~have descended~> are the descendants~~} by true generation {~~from~>of~~} pre-existing forms. Passing over {~~authors from~>allusions to the subject in~~} the classical {~~period to that of Buffon~> writers, the first author who in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was Buffon.~~} {++But as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different periods, and as he does not enter on the causes or means of the transformation of species, I need not here enter on details.++}
