# atom-criticmarkup

### About
Forked from [lodestone](https://github.com/lodestone/critic-markup) who wrote "This is my attempt to bring CriticMarkup to Atom." in their README.

[Critic Markup](http://criticmarkup.com/) is a way for authors and collaborators to track changes in plain-text [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) documents.

I am adding additional features (like key bindings!)

### Key bindings

Key bindings are working:

  cmd-alt-a: addition  
  cmd-alt-d: deletion (fails on default mac setup because the system uses that for hide/show dock)  
  cmd-alt-backspace: deletion  
  cmd-alt-s: substitution  
  cmd-alt-h: highlight  
  cmd-alt-c: comment
